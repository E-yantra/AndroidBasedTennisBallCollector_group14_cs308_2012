AIM
* Make an android controller for Firebird V
(Take it from SRS, which vinod is writing)






/******************************************************************************/

DESCRIPTION

Code Organization
- Android Application Code
    - Android Setup
        http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee368/Android/Tutorial-1-Basic-Android-Setup-Linux.pdf
    - Image Processing Code - OpenCV
        http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee368/Android/Tutorial-2-OpenCV-for-Android-Setup-Linux.pdf
- Firebird Controller Code
    - RTOS/muCos/Esterel - whatever
- Video Transmission Code
    - TODO:yet to be decided.


/******************************************************************************/

Ideas:

* Extend the connection to GSM
ie., by using mobile sim cards, now we are limited by geographical locations
we can even use SIM cards to transmit live video via videocalling. (3G)
* Make the connection using TCP/IP i.e, using mobile's WiFi.
Similar to https://github.com/saifhhasan/firebird_android_controller
but we may have to 
* We can use the Android API for firebird - a project by Darshan and group.


Combine the following projects:
    Robotic arm mvmt project
    Controlling Firebird V using an Android based phone via Bluetooth
        http://www.e-yantra.org/home/projects-wiki/item/140-controlling-firebird-v-using-an-android-based-phone-via-bluetooth-controlling-firebirdv-atmega2560
    Tennis Ball Collector using ATmega 2560 Robot
        http://www.e-yantra.org/home/projects-wiki/item/131-tennis-ball-collector-using-atmega-2560-robot
Fork:
    TCP/IP project
    Android API

/******************************************************************************/


TODO:

* We need to learn
    - Java (most  of the Android code will be in Java)
    - Android API, using its simulator
    - Xbee, RTOS usage
    - Read and research about various projects available online.
    - Latex how to use it - writing templates in it.

*


/******************************************************************************/

REPORT
Just have a look at any of the project report in 
 http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee368/Project_11/index.html 
 to get a flavour our how should out project report be like.
    

* Create a latex report template
    - Write a reade file for automatic report generation.
    - Separate template from main content
* Include all step by step procedures to install, and do project to even a noob
 in a project report.
    - Appendices 
        - to give addtional info like various installations and usage guides
* Include costs of various items in the Report



/******************************************************************************/

Challenges
* Transmit live video to android mobile.
    - Camera to be mounted on Bot, but how to receive it on android mobile
        - Bluetooth
            - Slow
            . found a few links but no concrete idea yet
        - WiFi
            + Fast
            - More difficult in implementing

* Doing the image processing on Android mobile.
    - Using OpenCV
        + Stanford Lab already does it.

/******************************************************************************/

TIMETABLE
* Every Week:
    - Project team meet (2 hrs)
    - followed by code review and merging of code.
* After every bug fix, feature addition, etc make a commit and push it to your 
 branch. Use a meaningful commit message for every commit
